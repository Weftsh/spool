//! Shared PostgreSQL instance for tests: one server per test process, one
//! uniquely-named database per test — the same discipline as the MinIO
//! harness, so control-plane tests are hermetic and parallel-safe.
//!
//! Binary resolution order: `$STRATUM_PG_BIN_DIR` → `initdb` on PATH →
//! newest `/usr/lib/postgresql/<v>/bin` (the layout Debian/Ubuntu — and
//! the GitHub Actions runner image — installs).
//!
//! PostgreSQL refuses to run as root, so when the test process is root
//! (dev containers) the harness chowns the data directory to the
//! `postgres` system user and spawns `initdb`/`postgres` under that uid.
