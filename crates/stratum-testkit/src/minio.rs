//! Shared MinIO instance for tests: one server per test process, one
//! uniquely-named bucket per test.
//!
//! Resolution order, and the first entry is the one that matters on a
//! machine that is not Linux:
//!
//!   1. `$STRATUM_MINIO_URL` — an S3 endpoint that is **already running**,
//!      which the harness uses as-is and never spawns or kills. This is
//!      how a developer runs the Rust suites from a MinIO in Docker.
//!   2. `$MINIO_BIN` → `minio` on PATH → `.testkit/bin/minio` at the
//!      workspace root, spawned per test process. CI pre-populates that
//!      path so test runs stay network-free.
//!
//! **MinIO no longer publishes prebuilt binaries.** `dl.min.io`, which
//! this used to download from, answers `410 Gone` for every platform of
//! the pinned release, and the GitHub release carries no assets — the
//! same withdrawal that took `minio/minio` and `minio/mc` off Docker Hub
//! and moved `deploy/compose.yml` to quay.io. The container image is the
//! only artifact still published, so that is where the binary comes from
//! now: extracted from `quay.io/minio/minio:<pin>`, the same registry and
//! the same pin.
//!
//! That works where the test host matches the image — Linux, which is
//! CI. It cannot work on macOS, where the image's binary is an ELF that
//! will not execute. There is no darwin binary left to fetch anywhere, so
//! on a Mac the answer is (1): run the image and point the harness at it.
//! `minio_bin` says so in its error rather than leaving somebody to
//! rediscover it.
