//! The exit path must *reap* the postmaster, not wait out its deadline.
//!
//! `Pg::shared` lives in a `OnceLock`, which Rust never drops, so the
//! cluster is stopped from a `libc::atexit` hook instead of from
//! `KillOnDrop`. That hook used to send `SIGINT` and then poll
//! `libc::kill(pid, 0)` until a five-second deadline — but the postmaster
//! is a *direct child* of the test process and nothing ever waits on it,
//! so the moment it exits it becomes a **zombie**, and signal 0 succeeds
//! against a zombie for as long as it goes unreaped. The loop therefore
//! never returned early: every test binary that had touched a database
//! paid the full five seconds on the way out and then `SIGKILL`ed a
//! corpse.
//!
//! That is not a rounding error. `cargo test` runs test binaries one at a
//! time, and on the CI run this test was written against the gap between
//! one binary's last result and the next binary's first line had a median
//! of **5.01s** over 67 transitions — **4.5 minutes** of dead time in the
//! correctness gate and another 4.5 in the coverage job, which is a fifth
//! of each.
//!
//! `KillOnDrop::drop`, ten lines further down the same file, polls
//! `Child::try_wait()` — which reaps — and was always correct. Only the
//! hook, rewritten in raw `libc` because a `static` has no `Child` to call
//! it on, lost the property.
//!
//! So this measures the thing that actually costs: how long a test binary
//! takes to *exit* after its last test has finished.
