# Put the pinned MinIO server binary at .testkit/bin/minio.
#
# MinIO stopped publishing prebuilt binaries. `dl.min.io`, which the test
# harness and CI both used to curl, answers **410 Gone** for every
# platform of the pinned release, and the GitHub release carries no
# assets — the same withdrawal that took `minio/minio` and `minio/mc` off
# Docker Hub and moved `deploy/compose.yml` to quay.io, arriving at the
# other artifact a few weeks later. The container image is the only thing
# still published.
#
# **This pulls the image without a container runtime**, straight off a
# registry's HTTP API, and that is the whole reason the script exists
# rather than a `docker create` + `docker cp`. The three jobs that need
# MinIO — correctness, coverage, chaos — run on `weft-2x`, our own
# runners, whose image has no docker CLI and no socket *on purpose*:
# `Dockerfile.runner` says a runner that can talk to a daemon can escape
# its container. Reaching for a daemon there would have undone that to
# fetch a test dependency.
#
# The pin comes from `.minio-version`, which `crates/stratum-testkit`
# also `include_str!`s, so the harness and CI cannot run different
# MinIOs — a harness testing against a different store from the gate is
# a harness testing a different product.
